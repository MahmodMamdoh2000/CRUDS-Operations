n JavaScript, "cruds" typically refers to the basic operations performed on data in a database or data storage system. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four fundamental operations used to manage data.

Here's a brief description of each CRUD operation in JavaScript:

1. Create (C): This operation involves creating new data records. In JavaScript, you can use various techniques to create new data, such as sending HTTP POST requests to a server, using database query languages like SQL, or manipulating JavaScript objects and arrays.

2. Read (R): The read operation involves retrieving existing data records. In JavaScript, you can read data from various sources, such as reading from a database using SQL queries, making HTTP GET requests to an API, or accessing data stored in JavaScript objects or arrays.

3. Update (U): The update operation involves modifying existing data records. In JavaScript, you can update data by sending HTTP PUT or PATCH requests to a server, executing SQL update statements, or manipulating JavaScript objects and arrays.

4. Delete (D): The delete operation involves removing existing data records. In JavaScript, you can delete data by sending HTTP DELETE requests to a server, executing SQL delete statements, or removing elements from JavaScript objects and arrays.

These CRUD operations are fundamental to working with data in JavaScript applications, and they are often used in combination to perform various data management tasks.


Also in this project I used the regex principle to make sure of the validation of the data that the user enters and I used it on title and count 

Using regex in project can be beneficial for various tasks involving string manipulation, validation, and pattern matching. Here's a description of how you can utilize regex in your project:

When using regex in your project, it's important to consider the complexity and performance implications. Complex regex patterns can be difficult to read and maintain, and they may impact the performance of your application. It's recommended to test and optimize your regex patterns as needed to ensure they meet your project's requirements.
